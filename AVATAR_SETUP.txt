AVATAR IMAGE INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

The Lillimon profile picture you uploaded needs to be saved as:
📁 lillimon_avatar.jpg

IMPORTANT:
- Save the circular profile picture you just uploaded
- Rename it to exactly: lillimon_avatar.jpg
- Place it in the same folder as lillimon_dashboard.html

The dashboard is already configured to look for this file!

If you're deploying to Vercel/GitHub:
1. Add lillimon_avatar.jpg to your repository
2. Commit both files together
3. Deploy!

The image will appear in the top-right corner next to "Lillimon Creator Account"
